This 2-year Innovation Scholar position represents a unique opportunity for a Ph.D. early-career Research Data Scientist to work in the San Francisco Bay Area at one of the leading research hubs focusing on solving global unmet medical needs. The goal is publishable work, and to make innovative models and tools available to the full global health research community. Yet, it benefits from the infrastructure of a world-class pharmaceutical company, with an extensive global network of scientists across a wide range of disciplines, state-of-the-art research facilities, and with the opportunity to apply pioneering research in live, fast-moving, drug discovery projects.<br><br>Of singular importance for data science research is Novartis\\u2019 trove of historical data, acquired by literally generations of chemists and biologists. It includes 10,000s of assays, millions of compounds, and 10 millions of experimental measurements. These data have been integrated through the internally developed Profile-QSAR method [J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2019, 59(10), 4450\\u20134459], a massively multi-task stacked model that predicts bioactivity with accuracy comparable to 4-concentration dose-response measurements for 75% of Novartis\\u2019 15,000 largest bioassays. By contrast, conventional single-assay machine-learning models achieved this success for only 8% of assays, demonstrating the leverage of exploiting this extensive data resource. Besides making possible superior malaria models to identify new chemical matter, having the entire profile of bioactivity predictions for each compound enables identifying mechanisms of action from phenotypic screens and off-target activities to prioritize leads with good selectivity and ADMET properties. Profile-QSAR also has the unique ability for multiple research institutions to safely merge their multitask profile-QSAR models exactly as if they had actually shared their compound structures, targets, or bioactivities [J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2021, 61(4) 1603\\u20131616]\\u2014particularly valuable in collaborative global health. The Innovation Scholar will further develop the Profile-QSAR method, integrate it with other methods such as generative chemistry, DNA encoded libraries and structure-based design, apply it in Malaria drug discovery projects, and make the models and tools available to the wider scientific community.<br><br><strong>EEO Statement<br><br></strong><em> The Novartis Group of Companies are Equal Opportunity Employers and take pride in maintaining a diverse environment.
