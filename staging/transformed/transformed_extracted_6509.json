The company was founded in 2016 by an experienced ad tech marketer and two experienced machine learning experts who had previously worked at Yahoo, Twitter, and BrightRoll. We\\u2019re backed by leading early-stage investors including Amplify Partners, Homebrew, and Precursor Ventures. Intellimize intelligently optimizes websites for revenue driven leaders. Our machine learning automatically personalizes the buyer\\u2019s path to drive more web conversions. On average, our customers achieve 46% lift. We work with great companies like Drift, Looker, Unilever, Sumo Logic, Tableau, Emburse, and many more.<br><br>We believe everything we do flows from two things: making our customers wildly successful and having this be the best professional experience of our lives. This company is based on our customers achieving their goals, getting promoted, and getting up on stage saying great things about our work together.<br><br>Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the team has been working fully remotely. While we plan to move back into a San Mateo office once it is safe to do so, the engineering team will continue to embrace a remote-first culture and workflow. We welcome candidates from anywhere in the US or Canada. Our core working hours are centered around the Pacific time zone.<br><br><strong><u>A Few More Things About Us<br><br></u></strong>Intellimize optimizes websites to generate more revenue. We use machine learning to automatically optimize each buyer\\u2019s path to drive more web conversions. Our unique solution enables experimentation and personalization at an unparalleled scale, and it replaces traditional approaches to optimization such as A/B testing and rules-based personalization. These methods are too slow, require daily attention, and don\\u2019t automatically adapt to changes in behavior over time.<br><ul><li>We are entrepreneurs with deep experience in paid digital media and personalization.</li><li>Our team has experience building massive-scale personalized recommendation systems and machine learning infrastructure at Yahoo, Google, and Quora.</li><li>We move fast.
