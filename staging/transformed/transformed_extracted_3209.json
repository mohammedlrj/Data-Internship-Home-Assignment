More than half of Americans have a poor credit score or no score at all, and 78% live paycheck to paycheck. Without access to affordable financial products, they resort to high-interest credit cards, payday loans, and trigger overdraft fees to make ends meet \\u2014 which ultimately push them into deeper cycles of debt.<br><br>At Pinwheel, we believe that unlocking API access to payroll systems helps build towards a fairer financial system. Most people's money can be traced back to a payroll system (e.g., ADP, Paychex, Gusto) \\u2014 meaning those systems sit at the top of the financial stack and harbor a wealth of income and employment data, and tapping into them offers limitless possibilities. Here are just a few ways Pinwheel's solution helps our customers and their end users:<br><ul><li>Enable real-time, seamless direct deposit switching within a bank's UX, driving LTV and account profitability for banks, and giving users control over where their paycheck goes</li><li>Let consumers share their income and employment data directly with lenders, no paperwork required \\u2014 speeding up the process and delivering the high quality data lenders need in real time</li><li>Allow borrowers to repay their loans directly from their payroll \\u2014 massively de-risking loans for lenders and allowing customers to access fairer interest rates<br></li></ul><strong>What are we looking for?<br><br></strong>We are looking for skilled engineers to join our integrations engineering team.
