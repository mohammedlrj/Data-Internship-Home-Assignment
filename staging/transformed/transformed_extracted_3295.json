This platform will empower both Bing Search and Edge browser. The goal is to make sure our web index is comprehensive, fresh, and clean.<br><br>We try to answer the following questions about a given web site: For ranking the document, which part of the page is semantically important? The Web is vast, containing trillions of pages. How to discover and index every single useful page? Where can we find most of the fresh pages with lowest latency? How often does a page refresh? What is the best crawling strategy to optimize index freshness and capacity efficiency? Can we predict the utility of a page to users before even crawling it?<br><br>When users issue a tail query looking for something rare/niche, what kind of relevance errors does our ranking model make, and how can we overcome the errors by understanding the collection of documents and providing effective signals to the model?<br><br>These questions require us to understand site hierarchy organization, web graph computation based on hyperlink structure, document layout understanding based on DOM tree, and semantic representation of the textual information. We combine large-scale distributed processing, machine learning, data mining, and NLP techniques to solve these problems.<br><br>This team has both ML/NLP experts and systems gurus. It is a great place to gain experience in both fields and build a successful career.<br><br><strong><u>Responsibilities<br></u></strong><ul><li> Analyze issues, perform root cause analysis, build metrics, and propose and implement fixes or new features in ML and data pipelines.</li><li> Improve existing web understanding algorithms using web data and user data.</li><li> Build offline and online large-scale distributed data processing systems using Cosmos and similar large scale infrastructure.</li><li> Improve throughput and latency of existing systems.<br></li></ul><strong><u>Qualifications<br><br></u></strong>Required Qualifications:<br><ul><li> BS/MS degree in computer science or equivalent.</li><li> 3+ years software development experience in C++, C#, Java, Python or equivalent.</li><li> Experience in machine learning and NLP.<br></li></ul><strong><u>Preferred Qualifications<br></u></strong><ul><li> Masters or PhD, with focus on machine learning; specifically NLP, Relevance/ranking, Information Retrieval.</li><li> Experience in large scale data processing and machine learning is a plus.<br></li></ul>Microsoft is an equal opportunity employer.
