From the humblest NYC slice and a cup of joe to museum-quality lattes (and yes, avocado toast), each order represents a long paper trail and a series of truck deliveries.</p><p><br></p><p>With a rapidly growing market presence, Cheetah is already streamlining the daily workflow of hundreds of restaurants and small business owners. Using Cheetah\\u2019s services, they manage millions of dollars in monthly purchasing, while Cheetah eliminates the burden of costly sales reps and inflexible, inefficient distribution centers. Partnering with the largest suppliers in the US, Cheetah is bringing the Silicon Valley user experience to an industry that hasn\\u2019t evolved in decades. In the process, we\\u2019re helping to reintroduce the small business owner to the small farmer, global supply chains to familiar faces, and delivery and logistics workers to increased mobility and new opportunities.</p><p><br></p><p>At Cheetah, a relentless executive team has set out to change this reality, armed with deep industry and entrepreneurial experience, personal conviction, and $70M in funding from Eclipse, Floodgate, and the early backers of Facebook, Lyft and Airbnb.</p><p><br></p><p>Unencumbered by the old-school business models and practices, Cheetah has introduced unprecedented transparency in pricing and inventory to the SMB marketplace. In doing so, Cheetah allows the people who form the backbone of local economies to focus on what they love: cooking great food and providing excellent service. From the convenience of their phones, business owners can now order whatever they need, discover new, rare or seasonal specialty products, and prioritize their customers. No more rushing to unload your double-parked van, or waiting anxiously for a truck to show up with your weekly allotment of boxes.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Data Scientist (Operations)</u></strong></p><p><br></p><p>Cheetah is looking for a data scientist with experience designing and optimizing logistics and warehouse operations. This function is vital to the long-term success of the company and ensures that Cheetah warehouses are operating in an efficient way and customers receive their deliveries at the optimal time and freshness, while also minimizing operation / transportation costs. In this role, you will have the chance to redefine how restaurants and small businesses receive the supplies they need to run their organizations.</p><p><br></p><p>For this role you must be driven to understand complex problems and find unique, out-of-the-box solutions.

We want someone who loves modeling and writing code, diving into difficult problems and creating exceptional automated systems. This individual will work with the engineering team to deploy and evaluate model testing, and generate other hypothesis based experiments. You will define, measure and utilize metrics to build business cases and present them to your team and senior management.
