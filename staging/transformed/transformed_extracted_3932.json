As experts in reliability engineering, SREs are typically responsible for improving service availability, latency, scalability, performance, and efficiency; they remove toil from service management, and take ownership for changing production state, monitoring, incident response, and capacity planning. SREs take a holistic approach across client and server: they understand the dependencies both between and within services and drive continuous improvement across them. They care about the user experience and improve business outcomes as the business unit itself defines them. SRE as a discipline improves things via engineering first and foremost, rather than being a primarily reactive function.<br><br><strong>Preferred work locations:<br><br></strong>Atlanta, Georgia<br><br>Austin, Texas<br><br>Redmond, Washington<br><br>Reston, Virginia<br><br>Remote in the U.S.<br><br><strong><u>Responsibilities<br><br></u></strong><strong>Key Responsibilities:<br></strong><ul><li>Provide technical engineering for a cross-functional, highly visible, operations team supporting the Identity platform for Microsoft\\u2019s corporate network.</li><li>Identify opportunities and drive the implementation of automation to improve service health, manageability, reliability and telemetry.</li><li>Own, triage, investigate and resolve service issues with an emphasis on broad communications, learning &amp; teaching throughout the process</li><li>Read, write, configure, design, and script end-to-end service telemetry, alerting and self-healing capabilities for platforms.</li><li>Author functional and technical documentation.
