Funded by Andreessen-Horowitz and founded by serial entrepreneur and former Head of Health at Apple (Anil Sethi), it began with the simple idea that anyone should be able to manage their own medical records, but was motivated by the harder reality of helping Anil\\u2019s own sister fight her battle with cancer.
