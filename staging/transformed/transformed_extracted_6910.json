Our platform enables organizations to license their providers in new states, verify existing credentials, and get in-network with insurance payers. In less than a year, we\\u2019ve launched our platform, built an all-star team, powered dozens of great companies, and served thousands of healthcare providers across the industry!<br><br>The heart of Medallion\\u2019s success lies in bringing modern technology and automation to the archaic world of healthcare administration. Our web platform and API provide a robust (and, dare we say, delightful!) abstraction over hundreds of healthcare systems, processes, and protocols from medical and insurance bodies across the US. This abstraction is brought to life by a suite of data integrations, web crawlers, and backend intelligence that turns crucial but complicated, manual processes into automated, turn-key solutions, critical to the growth of our customers.<br><br>Medallion is built by a small, distributed team of seasoned product-minded engineers with decades of experience across startups and public companies alike.
