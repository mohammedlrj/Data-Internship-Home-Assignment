The Core ML team works with a simple mission of making it easy to use machine learning at Robinhood. The team is executing the mission by building the core infrastructure (eg. training and serving platform, feature platform) and a number of model-as-a-service solutions (eg. embedding service, multi-arm bandit service). The team works closely with data scientists who are applying ML in various spaces such as risk and fraud, growth, customer understanding etc. to ensure that they are able to ship their solutions to create business value.<br><br>As a <strong>machine learning engineer focused on applied ML</strong>, you will work closely with other teams to identify critical problems that can be solved using ML. You will co-develop a model, sometimes an ML system, with them and then, whenever possible, build and deploy the solution as a reusable and generalizable ML service.
