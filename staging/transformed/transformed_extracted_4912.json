From the humblest NYC slice and a cup of joe to </p><p>museum-quality lattes (and yes, avocado toast), each order represents a long paper trail and a </p><p>series of truck deliveries. </p><p><br> </p><p>With a rapidly growing market presence, Cheetah is already streamlining the daily workflow of </p><p>hundreds of restaurants and small business owners. Using Cheetah\\u2019s services, they manage </p><p>millions of dollars in monthly purchasing, while Cheetah eliminates the burden of costly sales </p><p>reps and inflexible, inefficient distribution centers. Partnering with the largest suppliers in the </p><p>US, Cheetah is bringing the Silicon Valley user experience to an industry that hasn\\u2019t evolved in </p><p>decades. In the process, we\\u2019re helping to reintroduce the small business owner to the small </p><p>farmer, global supply chains to familiar faces, and delivery and logistics workers to increased </p><p>mobility and new opportunities. </p><p><br> </p><p>At Cheetah, a relentless executive team has set out to change this reality, armed with deep </p><p>industry and entrepreneurial experience, personal conviction, and $70M in funding from </p><p>Eclipse, Floodgate, and the early backers of Facebook, Lyft and Airbnb. </p><p><br> </p><p>Unencumbered by the old-school business models and practices, Cheetah has introduced </p><p>unprecedented transparency in pricing and inventory to the SMB marketplace. In doing so, </p><p>Cheetah allows the people who form the backbone of local economies to focus on what they </p><p>love: cooking great food and providing excellent service. From the convenience of their phones, </p><p>business owners can now order whatever they need, discover new, rare or seasonal specialty </p><p>products, and prioritize their customers.
