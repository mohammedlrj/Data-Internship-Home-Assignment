But we also do quite a bit of research to stay up to date with the latest technologies/algorithms.</li><li>We are very collaborative; you will likely get lots of ideas from the team.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What kind of problems do we solve?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;Our locomotives stream 350+ sensor information in real-time. We create predictive models to predict various component failures hours, days, and sometimes months in advance.</p><ul><li>There are high-frame cameras beside our tracks, capturing images of trains and rail cars as they pass. We design various Deep Learning and Computer Vision algorithms to detect certain objects of interest or issues and defects. We then optimize their performance and deploy them at the edge for real-time scoring and notification of our mechanical personnel upon detections.</li><li>Want to learn more?
