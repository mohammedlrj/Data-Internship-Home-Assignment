Immigrants are traditionally shut out of the financial system because they lack a financial identity. We are building technology to democratize access to financial services.<br><br>Improving access to financial services for everyone, especially for the underserved and immigrants has never been more important. They contribute $1.6T to the economy, have built many $100B+ companies, and generated millions of jobs. Still, immigrants don't get the services they deserve.
