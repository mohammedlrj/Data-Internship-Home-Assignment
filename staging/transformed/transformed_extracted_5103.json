From the humblest NYC slice and a cup of </p><p>joe to museum-quality lattes (and yes, avocado toast), each order represents a long </p><p>paper trail and a series of truck deliveries. </p><p><br> </p><p>With a rapidly growing market presence, Cheetah is already streamlining the daily </p><p>workflow of hundreds of restaurants and small business owners. Using Cheetah\\u2019s </p><p>services, they manage millions of dollars in monthly purchasing, while Cheetah </p><p>eliminates the burden of costly sales reps and inflexible, inefficient distribution centers. </p><p>Partnering with the largest suppliers in the US, Cheetah is bringing the Silicon Valley </p><p>user experience to an industry that hasn\\u2019t evolved in decades. In the process, we\\u2019re </p><p>helping to reintroduce the small business owner to the small farmer, global supply </p><p>chains to familiar faces, and delivery and logistics workers to increased mobility and </p><p>new opportunities. </p><p><br> </p><p>At Cheetah, a relentless executive team has set out to change this reality, armed with </p><p>deep industry and entrepreneurial experience, personal conviction, and $70M in </p><p>funding from Eclipse, Floodgate, and the early backers of Facebook, Lyft and Airbnb. </p><p>Unencumbered by the old-school business models and practices, Cheetah has </p><p>introduced unprecedented transparency in pricing and inventory to the SMB </p><p>marketplace. In doing so, Cheetah allows the people who form the backbone of local </p><p>economies to focus on what they love: cooking great food and providing excellent </p><p>service. From the convenience of their phones, business owners can now order </p><p>whatever they need, discover new, rare or seasonal specialty products, and prioritize </p><p>their customers. No more rushing to unload your double-parked van, or waiting </p><p>anxiously for a truck to show up with your weekly allotment of boxes. </p><p><br> </p><p><br> </p><p><strong>Data Scientist (Operations)</strong> </p><p><strong><br></strong> </p><p>Cheetah is looking for a data scientist with experience designing and optimizing </p><p>logistics and warehouse operations. This function is vital to the long-term success of </p><p>the company and ensures that Cheetah warehouses are operating in an efficient way </p><p>and customers receive their deliveries at the optimal time and freshness, while also </p><p>minimizing operation / transportation costs. In this role, you will have the chance to </p><p>redefine how restaurants and small businesses receive the supplies they need to run </p><p>their organizations. </p><p><br> </p><p>For this role you must be driven to understand complex problems and find unique, out- </p><p>of-the-box solutions. For example, you will be responsible for building and </p><p>implementing the models that predict the transit and service time of each delivery, </p><p>optimize transportation cost, and inform the product team on which new customer </p><p>facing features (e.g. delivery windows) to create. We want someone who loves </p><p>modeling and writing code, diving into difficult problems and creating exceptional </p><p>automated systems. This individual will work with the engineering team to deploy and </p><p>evaluate model testing, and generate other hypothesis based experiments. You will </p><p>define, measure and utilize metrics to build business cases and present them to your </p><p>team and senior management. This role will be an integral part of the data team and </p><p>will ensure Cheetah provides customers with an unparallelled delivery experience by </p><p>using data mining, mathematical and statistical modeling, and machine learning. </p><p><br> </p><p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> </p><p><br> </p><ul><li>Define and collect relevant data to perform further analyses on logistics and warehouse operations. </li><li>Develop, implement and optimize algorithms for Cheetah daily operations, such as: (1) Warehouse slot allocation and pick path optimization; (2) Product assortment and vendor type selection among regular-stocked, Just-In-Time, dropship, and consignment vendors; (3) Inventory outbound / inbound and labour scheduling; (4) Fleet assignment and routing optimization (including backhauls); and (5) Dynamic delivery windows selections. </li><li>Work with the engineering team to build processes to support fast, iterative experimentation - both for model creation and product development. </li><li>Collaborate with business intelligence teams to develop reports and visualization dashboards. </li><li>Build financial models to project key business metrics - on-time deliveries, cost per drop, error in delivery predictions - and develop KPIs to track performance. </li></ul><p><br> </p><p><strong>Qualifications:</strong> </p><ul><li>3+ years of professional experience with machine learning, predictive modeling,&nbsp;and optimization techniques, handling large, complex, data sets. </li><li>MS or PhD in a quantitative field such as Industrial Engineering, Operations Research, Computer Science, or a related Engineering degree. </li><li>Proven track record in solving business problems through fact based, scientific, methods. </li><li>Experience in Python /  R, SQL, and similar languages to manipulate and transform data into insights, as well as developing algorithms for deployment to production systems. </li><li>Deep understanding of linear / non-linear optimization, simulation, machine learning, and statistical analyses. </li><li>Strong verbal, writing, and presentation skills, as well as the ability to persuade, inspire, and motivate others. </li><li>Must have the ability to summarize key insights for both technical and non-technical audiences. </li></ul><p><br> </p><p><strong>B</strong><strong>enefits and Perks</strong> </p><ul><li>Flexible working schedule / location </li><li>Company happy hours, team building events, and intramural sports teams </li><li>Unlimited paid time off </li><li>Comprehensive medical/dental/vision insurance and commuter benefits </li><li>401(kplan and flexible spending benefits </li><li>The opportunity to work alongside a visionary team during Cheetah\\u2019s rapid </li></ul><p>growth!</p>\", \"employmentType\": \"FULL_TIME\", \"hiringOrganization\": {\"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"Cheetah\", \"sameAs\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/company/gocheetah\", \"logo\": \"https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQGMuIm2Pz8gAg/company-logo_200_200/0/1591197581104?e=1637798400&v=beta&t=9S_DLtLZa1RjlRoy3aCGWwfC-dWwNiEaU9YhwSqdcSU\"}, \"identifier\": {\"@type\": \"PropertyValue\", \"name\": \"Cheetah\"}, \"image\": \"https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQGMuIm2Pz8gAg/company-logo_100_100/0/1591197581104?e=1637798400&v=beta&t=FZzaG-9WEJhk50ncKJmUTyFzKLF5gsYG8VI3sZBA7Og\", \"industry\": \"\", \"jobLocation\": {\"@type\": \"Place\", \"address\": {\"@type\": \"PostalAddress\", \"addressCountry\": \"US\", \"addressLocality\": \"Pleasanton\", \"addressRegion\": \"CA\", \"postalCode\": \"94588\", \"streetAddress\": null}, \"latitude\": 37.658436, \"longitude\": -121.877}, \"skills\": \"\", \"title\": \"Data Scientist - Operations\", \"validThrough\": \"2022-02-16T21:13:35.000Z\", \"educationRequirements\": {\"@type\": \"EducationalOccupationalCredential\", \"credentialCategory\": \"bachelor degree\"}, \"experienceRequirements\": {\"@type\": \"OccupationalExperienceRequirements\", \"monthsOfExperience\": 36}}",
