This year alone we will send well over $1B to creators in over 140 countries and territories. Our ultimate goal is to bring about the Second Renaissance, a new flourishing of culture and creativity that will fundamentally change the nature of culture, media, and commerce. We are going to be one of the most positively impactful companies over the next decade.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>We recently closed our Series F round; we raised $155M at a valuation of $4B (up from $1.29B in September last year). We have an amazing set of investors like Thrive Capital, Index Ventures, Initialized Capital, NEA, and Tiger Global. We're particularly excited about 2021 because we're expanding (localizing) our product into multiple countries this year and are also working with many established creators on their Patreon launch. We are growing fast, and our revenue has surpassed that of companies like Shopify when they were pre-IPO.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>SecDevOps Security Engineer</strong></p><p><br></p><p>REMOTE ANYWHERE IN U.S.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Do you believe that creators should have the ability to get paid for the value they give to their fans?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p><p>We do, which is why we're building Patreon, a platform that powers membership services for creators with established followings.
