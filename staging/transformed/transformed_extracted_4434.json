We partner with state, county, and private foster care agencies around the country, helping them recruit and approve foster parents more quickly and empowering social workers by eliminating administrative paperwork. Our software also helps match families with children and helps track services to biological families to get on their feet and reunify with their children. Binti currently works with over 140 foster care agencies across 22 states. Rhode Island, New Mexico, Hawaii, and Washington have signed on to make our software their statewide solution.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Our goal is to be the end-to-end modular child welfare data system solution. Our Approvals and Placements modules are widely used and have significantly improved outcomes.&nbsp;Agencies working with us have approved 80% more families on average in their first year of using Binti, with a 16% reduction in time to approve and 20-40% savings in social worker time.
