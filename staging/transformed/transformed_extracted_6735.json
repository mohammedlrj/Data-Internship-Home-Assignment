As we transition back to the office, we are introducing our Workplace Flexibility Model. Most roles will be based out of our Sunnyvale office and balance in-office time with flexibility to support other needs you have in your life. This flexibility could be used to reduce the Bay Area commute burden by working from home a couple days a week, support parent or caregiver needs, or allow space for you to do the other things you love, whatever that might be! There are times when achieving great work is more productive when working where you work best. That\\u2019s the point of this model...flexibility for you. A few roles will be approved as fully remote. Those are determined by managers and approved by our senior team.</p><p>We anticipate following this flexibility model starting mid-July 2021 as we continue to follow local guidelines and protocol around COVID.</p>\", \"employmentType\": \"FULL_TIME\", \"hiringOrganization\": {\"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"Blue River Technology\", \"sameAs\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/company/bluerivertech\", \"logo\": \"https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQFB1G16_b_OOQ/company-logo_200_200/0/1625176220360?e=1638403200&v=beta&t=9EJ2buV63mva-3FXeswQh8adzuy9t9Tif3QqjmA6FP8\"}, \"identifier\": {\"@type\": \"PropertyValue\", \"name\": \"Blue River Technology\"}, \"image\": \"https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQFB1G16_b_OOQ/company-logo_100_100/0/1625176220360?e=1638403200&v=beta&t=eSDsKX80riTPrj-Rz_M8FWP6-eIEBbLafeH1kyQyOUQ\", \"industry\": \"Computer Software\", \"jobLocation\": {\"@type\": \"Place\", \"address\": {\"@type\": \"PostalAddress\", \"addressCountry\": \"US\", \"addressLocality\": \"Sunnyvale\", \"addressRegion\": \"CA\", \"postalCode\": \"94089\", \"streetAddress\": null}, \"latitude\": 37.373676, \"longitude\": -122.036575}, \"skills\": \"\", \"title\": \"Sr. Systems Engineer (Software)\", \"validThrough\": \"2021-10-02T05:23:36.000Z\", \"educationRequirements\": {\"@type\": \"EducationalOccupationalCredential\", \"credentialCategory\": \"bachelor degree\"}, \"experienceRequirements\": {\"@type\": \"OccupationalExperienceRequirements\", \"monthsOfExperience\": 60}}",
