SREs are a blend of pragmatic operators and software craftspeople that apply sound engineering principles, operational discipline, and mature automation to our environments and the Elsevier's production codebases. SREs can specialize in systems, whether it be networking, the Linux kernel, or some more specific interest in containers, observability, scaling, algorithms, or distributed systems.</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Elsevier has a complex portfolio of products and services. We have a cloud native, microservices and&nbsp;container platform strategy&nbsp;which seeks to improve how we deliver quality software to customers at a higher pace.
