To make it work, it&nbsp;has to&nbsp;be clear where to focus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Lineup.ai is a sophisticated digital tool that interprets contextual data to accurately predict how busy a restaurant will be \\u2014 today, next week, or in three weeks. In partnership with best-in-class restaurants, and leveraging advanced machine learning models, the team at Lineup.ai has developed a solution by rooting our innovation efforts in our purpose \\u2013 to help our customers mitigate risk and uncertainty. By considering multiple key factors that affect demand, Lineup.ai increases confidence and consistency in a manager\\u2019s decisions.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Our easy-to-use software shows executives and managers exactly what they need to make better, faster decisions toward increasing efficiency and improving profitability. We\\u2019ve built a custom prediction engine tailored to each store\\u2019s specific geography, weather, and local events.
