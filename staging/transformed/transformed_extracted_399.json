They imagined a business that would provide financial services to clients as well as technology services to other financial firms. The result of their vision is Aladdin, our industry leading, end-to-end investment management platform. With assets valued over USD $8 trillion managed on Aladdin, our technology empowers millions of investors to save for retirement, pay for college, buy a home and improve their financial wellbeing.<br><br>Data is at the heart of Aladdin and increasingly the ability to consume, store, analyze and gain insight from data has become a key component of our competitive advantage. The DOE team is responsible for the data ecosystem within BlackRock. Our goal is to build and maintain a leading edge data platform that provides highly available, consistent data of the highest quality for all users of the platform, notably investors, operations teams and data scientists.
