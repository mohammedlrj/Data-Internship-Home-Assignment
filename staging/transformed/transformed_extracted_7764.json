We apply advanced engineering and data science techniques to partner with the most advanced fleets in the country to improve their real-world fuel economy - driving bottom line savings and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp;Our first product, TruckWings\\u2122, is the industry\\u2019s first active aerodynamics product for Class 8 trucks that automatically closes the tractor-trailer gap at highway speeds. Deployed across major national fleets, TruckWings have completed over 250 million miles of highway driving.&nbsp;TruckWings are controlled by a proprietary cloud-connected telematics device which both operates and measures the performance of TruckWings and the trucks.&nbsp;With these technologies, we are making a dent in the 300M metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions produced annually by tractor-trailers, while also increasing the profitability of our customers.
